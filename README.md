**Notes on Fly Out Capabilities**

Bootstrap does not support multi-level drop downs. Unfortunately this means that Bootstrap navigation menus can only go one down from top level. The Bootstrap team’s official stance on multi-level drop downs is: 

*Not right now. I’m not convinced levels and levels of dropdowns are an ideal situation on any site or application (taken from GitHub issue https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/160)*

The linked issue does give some insight as to why and discusses possible alternatives.

Our implementation is meant to stay true to Bootstrap functionality but [mariotacke](https://github.com/mariotacke) has extended our implementation for multi-level funcationality. The project can be found at: https://github.com/mariotacke/multi-level-forms-bootstrap-menu
